=========================
A mod that adds unused, unimplemented, or removed features back into Minecraft

This mod is now under new management with my permission and can be found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rediscovered

If you have any issues, please report it on their issue tracker. Bugs and issues for 1.7.10 and 1.8.8 will NOT be addressed, as these are legacy versions and are no longer supported.
